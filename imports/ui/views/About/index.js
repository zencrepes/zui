          <p className={classes.paragraph}>
            GitHub is a great platform, but managing projects across multiple
            organizations and repositories can be tedious. From velocity
            metrics, to issues searching, it lacks project management features
            when taken outside of the context of a single repository.
          </p>
          <p className={classes.paragraph}>
            There are third-party tools to provide a project management layer
            across organizations and repositories, but those also have their own
            drawbacks and a chunk of their features are directly dependent on
            their platform.
          </p>
          <p className={classes.paragraph}>
            ZenCrepes was built to try to address some of these challenges,
            while helping to bring consistency in cross-org, cross-repo
            projects. ZenCrepes is only built on top of the GitHub API model,
            all of the data in ZenCrepes is directly hosted on GitHub. <br />
            Your team can operate with GitHub issues as normal, while a
            centralized view is available in ZenCrepes.
          </p>
          <p className={classes.subtitle}>Client-side only</p>
          <p className={classes.paragraph}>
            ZenCrepes is built as a client-side application. We don&apos;t have
            a duplicate index of GitHub data in our own servers, all happen
            directly between you and GitHub.
          </p>
          <p className={classes.paragraph}>
            It means that initial load time will be slower (while all issues are
            loaded in memory), ZenCrepes cannot be automatically notified about
            changes happening in GitHub (as you would see otherwise through
            GitHub hooks), or browser performance (limited to 1 CPU thread)
            might result in lags for projects with a very large number of
            issues.
          </p>
          <p className={classes.paragraph}>
            Whenever possible, ZenCrepes only loads newly updated data (for
            GitHub issues and milestones for example). At other times,
            everything has to be loaded (such as when refreshing Labels).
